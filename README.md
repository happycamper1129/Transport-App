# NetworkArch

NetworkArch is an Flutter app, that allows to diagnose Internet connections, discover details about Wi-Fi & Cellular networks and use many network-oriented tools:

- Ping
- LAN Scanner
- Wake On LAN
- IP Geolocation
- Whois
- DNS Lookup

I tried to follow the Material 3 Design Guidelines as much as possible, but Flutter still hasn't got the Material 3 fully implemented.
